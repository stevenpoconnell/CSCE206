# CSCE206

All of my CSCE 206 Assignments. There are little to no comments in the code. Everything should compile and work as expected with the exception of 1 or 2 projects where I didn't recieve a perfect score. This repository is staying up to serve as a personal backup and place for me to showcase my programming experience. This repository is not intended to be used by other students, and doing so would be a violation of the Aggie Honor Code.
